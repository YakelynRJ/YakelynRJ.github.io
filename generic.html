								<h2>About me</h2>
								<p>My name is Yakelyn Ramos Jauregui and I am from Peru, especifically from Huancayo located in the central Andes highlands. Growing up in a farmworkers family, I had the first-hand experience that El Niño and La Niña impact people's livelihood. The lack of seasonal to interannual predictability has significant impacts not only in people lives but also in my country's economy. That's why I chose to study Meteorology. In 2009, I moved to Lima to start my undergraduate studies in Meteorology at the National Agrarian University (Peru), which I successfully finished in 2013 after my internship as a research assistant at the Geophysical Institute of Peru (IGP). In 2014, I got my Engineering degree by the defense of my thesis titled “The effect of climate change on Tumbes precipitation by using the output of Global Climate Models (CMIP5)”. Working as a research assistant, I developed my expertise in management, analysis, and diagnostic of Global Climate Models (GCM) outputs, many languages programs such as Fortran and Matlab, as well as the improvement of my academic and analytical skills in atmospheric science. In 2015, I began to follow new topic research: the westerly winds events (WWE) to make a forecast of ocean Kelvin waves, which commonly impact the Peruvian coast. These pulses could potentially predict the onset or maintenance of El Niño, and because of the practical importance of these pulses, my focus was to identify weather systems and patterns that generate them in the western part of the Pacific Ocean. We expected to use these mechanisms to predict or monitoring El Niño development. Unfortunately, I realized that my knowledge and experience in tropical meteorology were limited, and to increase my knowledge and experience, and I decided to study abroad. In 2017, I started the Ph.D. program in Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington under the supervision of Prof. Shuyi Chen.</p>
